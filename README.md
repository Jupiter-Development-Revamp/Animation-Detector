# Animation-Detector
Detects inappropriate animations seen in Infinite Yield. If I missed anything, you can check my server out (go to this GitHub's readme) and message me.

The importance of this is to remove inappropriate animations in most games on ROBLOX. I've taken notice of more complaints online and decided to consult a friend (https://github.com/H17S32). I am very appreciative of his help regarding this project. My goal when creating this was to create a good, modifiable system for developers to implement easily into their games. Im shocked it is as easy as it was, I was expecting more work, which was why I decided to look into it after seeing more and more recent complaints regarding this issue.

All stars are appreciated on this repo, credits aren't required, this can be modified, I do not care. I do request (not required) that you include where you got this, so other devs can access it as well.
